  \caption{\textbf{A-D}: In- and out-degree distributions in the
    network types considered. Where the degree is distributed
    according to a binomial distribution $B(N,p)$, where $N=999$ is
    the number of targets or possible sources for each node and
    $p=0.116$ the independent connection probability in each pair.}
