  \caption{Degree distributions and evaluation of rewiring algorithm %
    %
    \textbf{A}: In-degree distribution in anisotropic (blue), rewired
    anisotropic (green, dashed), distance-dependent (purple, dashed)
    and random networks (grey). In random networks, a connection between
    two neurons exists independently with probability $p$ and the in- and
    out-degree distributions are distributed according to a binomial
    distribution $B(N,p)$, where $N=999$ is the number of targets or
    possible sources for each node. %
    %
    \textbf{B}: In-degree distribution in the tuned anisotropic (red),
    rewired tuned anisotropic (grey, dashed), distance-dependent
    (purple) and random networks (grey). %
    %
    \textbf{C}: Out-degree distribution for networks as in A. %
    %
    \textbf{D}: Out-degree distribution for networks as in B. %
    %
    \textbf{E}: Probability density distribution of the anisotropy
    degree $\lambda$ in the networks, showing that there is strong
    anisotropy in connectivity in anisotropic networks (blue) but
    not in rewired (green) or distance-dependent networks (purple). %
    %
    \textbf{F}: As in E but for tuned anisotropic (red), rewired tuned
    anisotropic (grey) and distance-dependent networks (purple).}
