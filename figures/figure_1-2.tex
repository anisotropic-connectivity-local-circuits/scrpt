\caption{{\bf Anisotropic network model} \textbf{A}: Algorithm for the
  generation of the network. First the $N$ nodes (grey dots) are
  distributed randomly on the square surface. Then, for each source
  node (shown as $\Delta$, identification number in the bottom left
  corner) a random angle $\alpha \in [0,2\pi)$ is chosen (1.). The
  target nodes for $\Delta$ are found within euclidean distance of
  less than $\frac{w}{2}$ of the projection from $\Delta$ in
  direction of $\alpha$ (2., projection shown in blue,
  dashed). Connections are then established from the source to the
  target nodes (3., targets of $\Delta$ shown in blue, remaining
  unconnected nodes in grey). \textbf{B}: Targets of another node
  (identification number 54) with different location and projection
  angle $\alpha$.}
