\caption{{\bf Anisotropic network model} \textbf{A}: Algorithm for the generation of the network. First the $N$ nodes (grey dots) are distributed randomly on the square surface. Then, for each source node (shown as $\Delta$, identification number in the bottom left corner) a random angle $\alpha \in [0,2\pi)$ is chosen (1.). The target nodes for $\Delta$ are found within euclidean distance of less than $\frac{w}{2}$ of the projection from $\Delta$ in direction of $\alpha$ (2., projection shown in blue, dashed). Connections are then established from the source to the target nodes (3., targets of $\Delta$ shown in blue). \textbf{B}:}
