  \caption{\textbf{Anisotropy in stereotypical morphology of layer 5
      pyramidal cells}. \textbf{A}: Axon reconstruction of thick
    tufted layer 5 rat somatosensory cortex (P14, retraced from
    \textcite{Romand2011}). Triangle symbolizes soma. \textbf{B}: Axon
    branch density heatmap. Five tracings as in A (all retraced from
    \cite{Romand2011}) were overlayed with soma algined in the center
    and main axon pointing downwards (white dashed line). High branch
    density (yellow colors) is found along the main axon projection
    revealing an anisotropy in axon morphology. \textbf{C}: As in A,
    but for dendrite. \textbf{D}: Dendrite branch density heatmap
    obtained as in B. High dendrite branch density is found
    isotropically around the soma.}
