\caption{{\bf Network models} \textbf{A}--\textbf{D}. Graphic representation of the different network types. For each model the full network area is shown and the $N=1000$ neuron locations are indicated as gray dots. For a single cell (triangle, node number shown in bottom right corner) target nodes of its outgoing connections are marked in color, revealing the typical connectivity in the model. \textbf{E}--\textbf{F}. Visualization of the rewiring algorithm for a single edge between two neurons of distance $x$. First, possible targets within distance $x \pm \varepsilon/2$ are identified (hatched nodes). Then, from the possible targets one node is chose at random and the rewired edge projects from the original source vertex $v$ to the new target $t'(e)$. \textbf{G} Connection probability between two nodes dependent on their distance matches in the networks from A,B and C. \textbf{H} Distance-dependent connection probability profile of the tuned network, matched to the findings of Perin et al.~(2011) \cite{Perin2011}.
