  \caption{Overrepresentation of reciprocal connections %
    %
    \textbf{A}: In anisotropic (blue) and tuned anisotropic networks
    (red) occurrences of unconnected, unidirectionally and
    bidirectionally pairs were counted and these values were divided
    by an expected count of $N(N-1)(1-p)^2$ for unconnected,
    $N(N-1)p(1-p)$ for unidirectionally connected and $N(N-1)p^2$ for
    reciprocally connected pairs. Here $p=0.116$ is connection density
    in all network types. Reciprocally connected neuron pairs are
    overrepresented in both anisotropic and tuned anisotropic
    networks. %
    %
    \textbf{B}: Overrepresented reciprocal pairs also occur in rewired
    and and distance-dependent networks. For unconnected (left),
    unidirectionally connected (middle) and bidirectionally connected
    pairs (right), the relative count. While general
    overrepresentation is found, no significant difference to the
    rewired mode is identified %
    %
    \textbf{C:} Overrepresentation as found by Perin et al. is
    distance-independent and is not affected by anisotropy %

    \textbf{D:} this}
