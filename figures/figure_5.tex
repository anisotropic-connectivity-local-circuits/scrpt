  \caption{Densely connected groups of neurons appear more frequently
    in networks with anisotropy. \textbf{A}: In anisotropic (blue) and
    tuned anisotropic networks (red) we sampled $n=2.5 \times 10^6$
    groups of 3 neurons and counted the connections within each
    group. This process was then repeated for the rewired anisotropic
    and tuned anisotropic networks. For each number of connections, we
    plotted the difference between occurrences of this connection
    count in random groups in anisotropic and rewired networks,
    divided by the number of occurrences in rewired networks. Fully
    connected groups did not occur in tuned anisotropic
    networks. \textbf{B}: Relative frequency of number of connections
    occurring in groups of 3 neurons in tuned anisotropic (red) and
    rewired tuned anisotropic network (black). \textbf{C-D}: As in A-B
    for groups of 6 neurons. \textbf{E-F}: As in A-B for groups on 8
    neurons. \textbf{G}: As in A for groups of 12 neurons.}
