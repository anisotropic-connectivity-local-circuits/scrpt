\section*{Introduction}

% why nonrandom network organization is so important
The network structure has large effect on functional properties of the network such as correlations \cite{Pernice2011}


% examples of nonrandom connectivity - time to cite!



% recent work - Marina paper. What do we do better?


% raise the big question --- what BIOLOGICAL characteristics could shape the structure?

% morphology
While neuron morphology is generally diverse, pyramidal cells in the layer 5 show rather  (Fig~\ref{fig:stereo_morph}).
