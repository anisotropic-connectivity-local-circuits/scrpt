\section*{Introduction}

% why nonrandom network organization is so important
The network structure has large effect on functional properties of the network such as correlations \cite{Pernice2011}


% examples of nonrandom connectivity - time to cite!



% recent work - Marina paper. What do we do better?


% raise the big question --- what BIOLOGICAL characteristics could shape the structure?

% morphology
Here we turn stereotypical features of the . In general, neuron morphology is highly diverse, ranging from . However, within a neuron type in a specific, morphology can be . Pyramidal cells in the layer 5 show rather  (Fig~\ref{fig:aniso_morph}).

% we call this morphological anisotropy.
