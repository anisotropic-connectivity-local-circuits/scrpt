\subsection*{Anisotropic network model}

Here we consider a network model

The model is implemented as an adapted version of a two-dimensional
directed random geometric graph: additionally to the random position
on the unit square, each node is assigned a uniformly distributed axon
projection angle $a$. For each vertex $v$, directed connections are
then established to nodes with distance $\leq \frac{w}{2}$ to the
projection ray originating from $v$ with angle $a$
(Fig.~\ref{fig_model} A). This \textit{anisotropic network
  model} is determined by two parameters; network size $N$ and the
\enquote{axon width} $w$.
