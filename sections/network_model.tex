We consider four types of random network models and analyze their
connectivity structure. The \textit{anisotropic} and \textit{tuned
anisotropic} network models implement the anisotropy in the
. The \textit{rewired} version of those networks serve as a baseline
. The \textit{distance-dependent} network allows for further
distinction between effects.

\subsection*{Anisotropic networks}

The anisotropic network model is the simplest form of a random network
featuring anisotropy in connectivity. In the model the $N$ nodes of
the network are first distributed uniformly at random on a square of
side length $L$. Each node $v$ is randomly assigned an angle $\alpha
\in [0,2\pi)$. Directed connections are then established from $v$ to
other nodes with distance less than $\frac{w}{2}$ to the projection
ray originating from $v$ with angle $\alpha$ (Fig.~\ref{fig:aniso_net}).
We chose $N=1000$, leaving the ratio $\frac{w}{L}$ as a free parameter
of the model determining the connection density of the network. We
selected $L=\SI{296}{\micro\meter}$ and determined $w=\SI{74.6}%
{\micro\meter}$ to obtain a connection density of $p=11.6$ as in
\cite{Song2005}. For a formal mathematical definition of the
anisotropic network model see supplementary material
(\ref{SI-sec:aniso_model}).

\subsection*{Rewired networks}
%
In order to identify connectivity features in a network that are a
direct result of its anisotropy in spatial connectivity, we introduce
rewired versions of anisotropic networks. In the rewiring process,
existing edges are assigned new targets in such a way that anisotropy
is eliminated while other important connectivity statistics
such as distance-dependent connectivity and in- and out-degree
distributions are preserved.

a modified
network that lacks anisotropy but is otherwise equivalent to the
original graph is required. This is achieved for a rewiring algorithm


we introduced a rewiring algorithm that eliminates anisotropy but preserves other important 


ia network without anisotropy as close as possible to. For this we introduce a rewiring algorithm operating
on the anisotropic networks.

Thus, to
discern features that are truly 

it is necessary to have a reference network that doesn't
feature anisotropy, but is otherwise equivalent to the anisotropic
model.

For this we introduced a rewiring algorithm on networks that
preserves first-order connectivity statistics %??  as well as the
distance-dependent connection probability profile. In this process
each connection with a spatial distance $x$ between source and target,
is rewired to a new random target that differs not more than
$\varepsilon$ from $x$ in spatial distance to the source vertex
(Fig.~\ref{fig_model} E-F). The resulting network has greatly reduced
anisotropy in connectivity, resembling that of a distance-dependent
network (supporting information).

Mention the outcome of the rewiring. Some very edges are lost in the process! %??

By rewiring only a section of all connections, a \textit{partial
  rewiring} produces a state that retains some anisotropy...



The relative width of the rewiring parameter was chosen as $\varepsilon / E = 0.05$ (??) to achieve an effective rewiring while closely maintaining the distance-dependent connection probability distribution of the original networks (see SI ??).

\subsection*{Distance-dependent networks}

A further reference network model are distance-dependent networks, in which each possible connection is realized independently with a probability $p(x)$, that depends only on the Euclidean distance $x$ between the source and target node (Fig.~\ref{fig:4_net_models}C). We refer to $p(x)$ as the distance-dependent connectivity profile.
