\subsection*{Neuron clusters}

\input{figures/figure_5.tex}



Specifically, the high edge counts in neuron clusters \textit{does
  not} depend on how anisotropy was implemented (tuned or normal)!

While rewiring, some connections have been lost (numbers!), that means
some of the overrepresentation might be due to that as this
relationship is strict (no new connections get introduced). It was
shown that small deviations *can* have a significant effect - see for
example 85c70a9f\_1v1. However, in average no such is noticeable as
expected. 

The significant overrepresentation from rewired to distance-dependent
is something important to think about. It kind of destroys the point
I'm trying to make: Anisotropy makes all the things! So, it's very
important to understand: Is it really true that the rewired-distance
effect is strong? (So far this has been only tested for one case:
8counts) Then, it's crucial to understand where this difference is
coming from. What aspect is in rewired, but not in distance, that
produces this?
