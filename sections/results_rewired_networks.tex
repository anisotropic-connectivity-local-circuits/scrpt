We generated a sample of five networks for the anisotropic, as well as
tuned anisotropic, rewired and distance-dependent versions.


\subsection{Rewired networks}

\begin{itemize}
\item  degree distribution unchanged
\item  anisotropy reduced (measure)
\item  further rewiring (rewiring the rewired network) does not change things  
\end{itemize}
