We generated samples of anisotropic and tuned anisotropic networks and
their respective rewired and distance-dependent versions (see
Methods). We analyzed the connectivity structures in these networks
and tested which connectivity features emerge from anisotropy in
spatial connectivity.

\subsection{Degree distributions}

The number of connections that a node in the network receives
(in-degree) or makes to other nodes (out-degree) is an important
measure of the network structure (citations??). In-degree
distributions in the original, rewired and distance-dependent networks
matched, but were in general broader than the in-degree distribution
in random networks of the same connection probability
(\figref{fig:io_deg}A,C). Due to axons extending



Taken together, rewired networks provide a reference to distinguish
feature that arrise solely due to anisotropy in spatial connectivity.

\subsection{Rewired networks}

We verified that the rewiring algorithm indeed works as
expected. For this Indeed, taking the vector (see Methods) that rewiring more
and more of the graph shifts the. Distance-dependent connection
probabilities (\figref{fig:4_net_models}G) and degree distributions
(\figref{fig:io_deg}A--D) remain by architecture of the rewiring
algorithm unchanged. We further tested if additionally rewiring.

% \begin{itemize}
% \item  degree distribution unchanged
% \item  anisotropy reduced (measure)
% \item  further rewiring (rewiring the rewired network) does not change things  
% \end{itemize}
