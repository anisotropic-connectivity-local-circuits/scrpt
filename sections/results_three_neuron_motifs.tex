\subsection*{Three neuron motifs}

Multiple paired whole-cell recordings in slices of rat visual and
somatosensory cortex revealed nonrandom structures in layer 5
pyramidal cells beyond pair connections -- the connection motifs
occurring in groups of three neurons deviate significantly of what one
would predict from the statistics of connections in neuron
pairs~\cite{Song2005, Perin2011}. Song et al.~for example found the
probability for a neuron pair $(u,v)$ to have a connection
$u \rightarrow v$ to be $p_{u \rightarrow v}= 0.0615$ and the
probability for a bidirectional connection was
$p_{u \leftrightarrow v} = 0.0542$. Form this they computed the
probability for a group of three randomly selected neurons to show,
for example, the connection motif 14 as labelled in
\figref{fig:3_motifs}A as
\begin{align*}
  \textbf{P}(\text{motif 14})= 3 \,p_{u \rightarrow v}^2
                                 \, p_{u \leftrightarrow v}, \label{eq:m14}
\end{align*}
where the factor of 3 is the number of possible ways to arrange the
pair connections to obtain the motif (for details and combinatorics of
all patterns see supplementary material \ref{SI-sec:3motif_stat}). The
actual occurrence of motifs in their data, however, differed
significantly from this computed expectation. For example, Song et
al.~found that motif 14 occurred approximately 3 ($\pm 2$) times more
often than expected. Other experimental studies \cite{Perin2011,
  Rieubland2014} and recent computational studies
\cite{Miner2016,Gal2017} have corroborated the specific occurrence of
three neuron patterns in cortical circuits.

Here we analyzed the counts of triplet motifs in the anisotropic
networks and compared it with the expected counts predicted from the
pair statistics extracted before. We found a highly specific
distribution of over- and underrepresentation of three neuron motifs
in anisotropic networks (\figref{fig:3_motifs}A) and tuned anisotropic
networks (\figref{fig:3_motifs}B).%

These data match well . Here, over- and underrepresentation of certain
motifs is a direct result of anisotropy in spatial connectivity as
rewired or distance-dependent versions of the networks do not show the
same degree of deviation from the expected motif occurrence.

The strongest deviations were
observed in motifs 8,10,12,14,15 and 16 (overrepresented) and motif 9 ??
(underrepresented). Rewired and distance-dependent networks show a
deviation from the expectation as well, however, the effect is much
stronger in anisotropic networks

Interestingly, this effect is much stronger than in
distance-dependent, where one might expect significant over- and
underrepresentations as well. Finding two connected pairs in a triplet
indicates a spatial closeness, that can be transferred to third pair
as well - thus one should find a higher connection chance. We find
that in comparable distance-dependent networks, only
