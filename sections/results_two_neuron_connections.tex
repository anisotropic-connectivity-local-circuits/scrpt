\subsection*{Two neuron connections}

Reciprocally connected pairs of neurons appear in cortical circuits
more often than would expect from a network that is connected randomly
\cite{Markram1997, Song2005, Perin2011}. We tested whether such
bidirectionally connected pairs are also overrepresented in
anisotropic networks. Indeed, we find that reciprocal connections
occur more ofthen(\figref{fig:two_neuron}A).
