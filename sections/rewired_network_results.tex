We generated a sample of five networks for the anisotropic, as well as tuned anisotropic, rewired and distance-dependent versions.


\subsection{Rewired networks}

- degree distribution unchanged
- anisotropy reduced (measure)
- further rewiring (rewiring the rewired network) does not change things
