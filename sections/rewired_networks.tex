In order to understand which structural features are shaped by the
anisotropy in the network, it is necessary to have a reference network
that doesn't feature anisotropy, but is otherwise equivalent to the
anisotropic model. For this we introduced a rewiring algorithm on
networks that preserves first-order connectivity statistics %??
as well as the distance-dependent connection probability profile. In
this process each connection with a spatial distance $x$ between
source and target, is rewired to a new random target that differs not
more than $\varepsilon$ from $x$ in spatial distance to the source
vertex (Fig.~\ref{fig_model} E-F). The resulting network has greatly
reduced anisotropy in connectivity, resembling that of a
distance-dependent network (supporting information).

Mention the outcome of the rewiring. Some very edges are lost in the process! %??

By rewiring only a section of all connections, a \textit{partial
  rewiring} produces a state that retains some anisotropy...



The relative width of the rewiring parameter was chosen as $\varepsilon / E = 0.05$ (??) to achieve an effective rewiring while closely maintaining the distance-dependent connection probability distribution of the original networks (see SI ??).
